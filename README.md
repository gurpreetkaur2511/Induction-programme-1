# Induction Programme
### Gurpreet Kaur ECA
## Day 1: 30 July 2025
My college journey at GNDEC Ludhiana began with a peaceful and spiritual experience. The day started with a programme at the **Gurdwara Sahib (8:30 AM – 9:30 AM)**, where we attended the **recitation of Japji Sahib, followed by Kirtan and Ardaas** for the success of our batch. It was a beautiful start to this new chapter of life.
The Gurdwara Sahib at GNDEC is designed like a ship. Sitting inside felt like we were travelling together in the Jahaz of Waheguru — a peaceful and spiritual start to our day.

During this session, I met a girl who is also from my branch (ECE), and since then, we’ve been sharing this journey together — a bond I cherish.

Following the prayer, **tea and snacks were served at Hostel No. 2**, giving everyone a chance to interact informally. 

At **10:00 AM**, the **inauguration ceremony** began in the auditorium. After completing the registration process, we were warmly welcomed by **Taranpreet Kaur**, our senior and host for the event.

We were introduced to college life and its diverse activities by **Mr. Harsimran Singh**. Then, a series of valuable sessions were conducted by:

- **Dr. Sehijpal Singh**, Principal of GNDEC, who motivated us to dream big and make the most of our years ahead.

After a lunch break (12:30 – 1:30 PM), we were taken on a **guided campus tour** by our teachers and seniors. This helped us get familiar with the college environment and feel more comfortable.

The **induction programme concluded at 2:30 PM**, leaving me with unforgettable memories, a strong sense of belonging, and excitement for what’s to come.

## Day 2 – 1st August 2025

The second day of our induction began on a spiritual note with the **recitation of Mool Mantar**, as suggested by **Dr. Harpreet Kaur**, Head of the Applied Sciences Department. This peaceful start helped us calm our minds and set the tone for a meaningful day ahead.

After that, we had a thought-provoking session by **Dr. Priya Darshani**, PhD in ECE, on *Universal Human Values*. She spoke about how the **real goal in life is happiness**, not just material success. Her session made us realise how we’re often chasing physical comforts, while true joy lies in maintaining harmony with ourselves and others.

Next, **Dr. Arvind Dhingra**, Director-STEP and Incharge-TAC, gave us an insightful presentation on the different **clubs and societies** in college. To make the session more interactive, he invited students on stage for some **fun ice-breaker activities**, which really helped us connect with our classmates.

Then, we had a **lunch break** for an hour.

In the second half, we appeared for **proficiency tests** in **English and Maths**, each lasting one hour. These were conducted by our seniors and gave us a sense of where we currently stand in these subjects.And with that, the day came to an end — filled with learning, reflection, and bonding.

This day reminded us that college life is not just about academics. It’s equally about **personal growth, emotional well-being**, and forming meaningful connections with others. From **spiritual grounding to intellectual engagement**, Day 2 gave us a glimpse of the balanced journey ahead.

## Day 3 : 4 August 2025

We began our day with the spiritual recitation of the Mool Mantra in the presence of Dr. Harpreet Kaur, HoD of Applied Sciences.

The first session introduced us to GitHub, where we were guided on how to create a repository and upload our daily reports. It was our first exposure to version control and technical documentation.

Next, our senior Taranpreet Kaur from the Causmic Club gave a detailed talk about the club’s activities, Instagram presence, and how to become a member. This was followed by a fascinating session on Motorsports by a mechanical senior, who explained the role of engineering in racing.

Dr. Priya Darshani then delivered an interactive lecture on Universal Human Values, where she focused on how to maintain a balance between relationships, physical facilities, and right understanding. She also addressed questions from students and shared tips on overcoming indulgence and depression.

After lunch, Prof. Aastik Sharma took an English class where he encouraged everyone to introduce themselves and write a letter describing their first day of college. He motivated us to shed the fear of speaking English.

The day concluded with a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) session by our seniors who introduced us to basic C++ programming. We successfully ran our first "Hello World" program and learned about variables.

**Overall, Day 3 was enriching — full of spiritual energy, practical knowledge, and new beginnings.**
